Purpose(expanded):		This is a configuration file that appears to drive some sort of effect, perhaps particle
	based. One could infer some of the functionality based on the command names.
	
	Without access to the underlying systems which are driven by these commands, I can't determine what they do
	or how they should be interpreted.
