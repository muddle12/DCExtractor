Purpose(expanded):
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	This is a configuration file for cloth physics. It contains a list of commands and
	comments related to specifying keyframes and bones related to some kind of internal physics system which
	simulates spring/cloth physics.
	
	Without access to the underlying systems which are driven by these commands, I can't determine what they do
	or how they should be interpreted.
